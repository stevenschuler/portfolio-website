    "p1": "Greetings! I'm Steven Schuler, a recent graduate from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2023). I'm currently looking to get my foot in the door in the software development/IT industry!",
    "p2": "My main programming passion centers around game development, where I thrive in using Unity to bring ideas to life. In particular, I am fascinated with finding creative ways to utilize AI in my games - whether that's by using pretrained chatbots or by creating my own agent using machine learning.  Beyond that, I enjoy crafting full-stack websites, like the one you're exploring now. ",
    "p3": "As a new grad, I'm committed to continuous learning. Currently, I'm expanding my full-stack development skills by creating this website using React and Gatsby. So far it has been a challenging but rewarding experience! Other skills that I am developing include 2D art (in particular, pixel art), 3D modeling (using Blender).",
    "p4": "Outside of programming, my hobbies include going to the gym and working on my fitness, playing all sorts of strategic video games (Civilization 5/6, stellaris, Age of Empires 2 are my all time favourites!), and everything hockey! I have played hockey my entire life, and now I play for the Puckin' Eh team in the IslandHockey101 league here in Victoria.",
    "p5": "The main purpose of this website is to showcase some of my projects that I am most proud of and to give you a glimpse into who I am as a person! I plan on upgrading and maintaining this site as I progress throughout my career, so check back often!"
